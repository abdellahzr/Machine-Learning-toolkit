# 🧠 Machine Learning Toolkit (from Scratch with NumPy)

This project is a complete implementation of fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms** developed entirely **from scratch using NumPy**, without relying on prebuilt frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

The goal of this project is to **build a deep understanding** of the mathematical principles and core mechanisms behind classical and modern ML algorithms by implementing every step manually — including model design, training, optimization, and evaluation.
